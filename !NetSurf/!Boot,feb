| Boot file for NetSurf. ( $Revision$ )
|
| This file sets up various system variables which NetSurf may use.
| Additionally, it places the NetSurf application sprites into the Wimp
| sprite pool.
|
| This file may be executed in two ways:
|   1. When NetSurf is first seen by the OS.
|   2. When NetSurf is run by the user (called from the !Run file).
| In the first instance, NetSurf-specific variables are set and non
| NetSurf-specific variables which are unset are initialised.
| In the second instance, all variables are set, irrespective of their
| previous state. This is achieved by use of the NetSurf$ForceVars 
| variable, which is set by the !Run file prior to calling this file.

| Set up NetSurf$Dir
If (("<NetSurf$Dir>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then Set NetSurf$Dir <Obey$Dir>

| Filetype -> Type name mappings
|
| These get set whether they were previously set or not
Set File$Type_132 ICO
Set File$Type_695 GIF
Set File$Type_69C BMP

| Application system variables
|
| See http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/help.shtml for more details.
If (("<NetSurf$Help>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then Set NetSurf$Help <NetSurf$Dir>.Docs.docs_en
If (("<NetSurf$Web>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then Set NetSurf$Web "http://www.netsurf-browser.org/"
If (("<NetSurf$Title>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then Set NetSurf$Title "NetSurf"
If (("<NetSurf$Publisher>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then Set NetSurf$Publisher "The NetSurf Developers"
If (("<NetSurf$Description>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then Set NetSurf$Description "Web browser"

| NetSurf Sprites
|
| The sprite file used is based on the OS and SpriteExtend versions:
|   RO <> 5 and SpriteExtend <  1.50 uses !Sprites<nn>
|   RO <> 5 and SpriteExtend >= 1.50 uses ASprites<nn>
|   RO =  5                          uses 5Sprites<nn>
Set NetSurf$Sprites <NetSurf$Dir>.ASprites
RMEnsure SpriteExtend 1.50 Set NetSurf$Sprites <NetSurf$Dir>.!Sprites
If (("<Boot$OSVersion>" >= "500") AND ("<Boot$OSVersion>" < "600")) Then IconSprites <NetSurf$Dir>.5Sprites Else IconSprites <NetSurf$Sprites>
Unset NetSurf$Sprites

| Acorn URI protocol
|
| Format: Alias$Open_URI_<scheme> <command to run>
|
| These are basically a last resort. The URI module will initially broadcast
| Message_URI_MProcess. If this isn't claimed, then it'll check if an 
| appropriate Alias$Open_URI_<scheme> variable is set. If such a variable 
| exists, then it will attempt to launch the task named by the variable. 
| If the launch is successful, the Message_URI_MProcess is rebroadcast.
| The -nowin is required to ensure only one window is opened (this only has
| an effect if the user has configured auto window opening at startup).
If (("<Alias$Open_URI_http>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then      Set Alias$Open_URI_http /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -nowin
If (("<Alias$Open_URI_https>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then     Set Alias$Open_URI_https /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -nowin
If (("<Alias$Open_URI_file>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then      Set Alias$Open_URI_file /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -nowin
If (("<Alias$Open_URI_gopher>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then      Set Alias$Open_URI_gopher /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -nowin

| ANT URL protocol
|
| Format: Alias$URLOpen_<scheme> <command to run>
|
| These handle the "load" stage of the protocol. The appropriate variable's
| existence is checked then, if it is present, the URL to be opened is
| appended to the string "URLOpen_<scheme> " and this is then fed to
| Wimp_StartTask.
If (("<Alias$URLOpen_http>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then       Set Alias$URLOpen_http /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -url %%*0
If (("<Alias$URLOpen_https>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then      Set Alias$URLOpen_https /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -url %%*0
If (("<Alias$URLOpen_file>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then       Set Alias$URLOpen_file /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -url %%*0
If (("<Alias$URLOpen_gopher>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then       Set Alias$URLOpen_gopher /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -url %%*0

| Claim HTML and URL files
|
| Format: Alias$@RunType_<hex> <command to run>
|
| Again, a fallback. The filer initially tries a DataOpen message. If that
| bounces, it looks at these variables.
If (("<Alias$@RunType_FAF>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then       Set Alias$@RunType_FAF /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -html %%*0
If (("<Alias$@RunType_B28>" = "") OR ("<NetSurf$ForceVars>" = "1")) Then       Set Alias$@RunType_B28 /<NetSurf$Dir>.!Run -urlf %%*0

| We don't claim the URI filetype as the spec tells us not to:
| "Applications must not set an Alias$@RunType variable for the URI filetype"
| Obviously this means that Browse/Phoenix and the Oreganos are incorrect.
